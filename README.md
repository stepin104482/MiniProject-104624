Entrepreneurship is the concept where there is a high chance of both success and failurerate . In an Organization both Quality and Quantity should be taken in to consideration and with the help of the business plan we can have the better Knowledge on our future goals of our company.Here We have A,B,C analysis where A are highly branded and items of B are in between A and C and The least expensive items are classified as C (ABC) is mainly based on the cost.

Sometimes We need to have Items in a large Manner for a better and smooth p anroduction so we go for VED analysis where Vital items are reuired in  a large number and without their availability the production can not continue for a day.Essential items are the one which lies between vital and desirable. Their abssence can be tolerated for 2-3 days and Desirable items are the one which are having less importance in terms of quantity.

Business plan will help us to know about ones company in a better way and we can have maximum success rate and if we have have less points we can change our plan by all these methods we can have a High success rate with less risks.
